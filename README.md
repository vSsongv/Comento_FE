### 👥Verify demand

- Initially, we used ChannelTalk to take questions and answer them to see if there was a demand for a ***‘chat answer service for programming questions’***.
- We promoted through Everytime(university schedule service of Korea), a platform popular among college students.
- We ran the service for about two weeks, we wanted to find out how satisfied the user were by sending them a link to a satisfaction survey when they finished.

- As shown above, we saw that there was a demand for the service and that people would be willing to pay for it.
- We have started ‘**Comento**’, a service that matches you one-on-one via chat to answer programming questions.
